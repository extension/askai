# Ask AI

**Ask AI** is a web-based application that uses real, human expert–answered questions from the **Ask Extension** knowledgebase to benchmark the performance of AI-generated responses against those provided by Cooperative Extension professionals.

## 🧠 What It Does

At its core, the app allows users to:

- 📌 View a real question asked through Ask Extension  
- 🧪 Compare multiple anonymized responses — one from a human expert, others from AI models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)  
- 🗳️ Vote on which response they believe is the most appropriate  
- 🕵️ Optionally, guess which answer came from a human expert  

Each vote contributes to an evolving leaderboard that ranks AI models and human experts based on perceived quality, helping to identify how well AI performs in the domain of public agricultural and Extension knowledge.
